      Welcome to Music Maneger by Mason Wang, a web application for organizing
      your music projects and tracks.

      <br />- To get started, browse your projects on the main page or create a
      new one using the "+" button. When creating a project, provide a name,
      description, type, status, and cover image. <br />- To manage songs,
      navigate to a project and click the "+" button to add a new song with a
      name, collaborators, instrumental file, and lyrics. Edit or delete
      projects and songs using their respective edit buttons. <br />- The player
      bar at the bottom allows you to play songs, adjust volume, toggle loop
      mode, and track playback progress. Click on any song to play it, and use
      the progress bar to navigate through the track.
